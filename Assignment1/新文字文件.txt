Report Content need to include sections in report writing video e.g. Execute Summary, Objective, About the data ...

Can join with other tables for extra fields ? e.g. member, items
But there is error:
#1267 - Illegal mix of collations (utf8mb3_unicode_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8mb3_general_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation '='

Any data dictionary?


To do:
Report Content in Video (TBC)
Data cleaning/ outliners
Determine additional attributes (customercluster + productcluster)
customercluster SQL 
productcluster SQL (Add a additional field)

customercluster Analysis
•	number of products bought
•	number of distinct products bought
•	revenues
•	number of visits
•	additional attributes that you think are appropriate

productcluster Analysis
•	number of distinct customers who buy the product
•	revenues
•	number of visits in which the product is bought
•	additional attributes that you think are appropriate
